This program was developed as part of the Spotify Challenge when we were supposed to access an API, retrieve the JSON information stored in multiple pages, remove the circular reference that we may find, and then create two JSON lists (with/without circular reference).

Technologies: Java, JSON, API
IDE: NetBeans
